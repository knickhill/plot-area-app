## Steps

- Started with installing and opening a jupyter notebook from a virtual environment
- Experimented with googlemaps Places and Maps api
  - Used python requests library with get() to pull up static and interactive maps
  - Also used geocoding
  - Embedded map output in jupyter notebook using Image and IFrame
- Now I'm trying to repeat the process using python client provided by googlemaps
  - I'm looking at two things - googlemaps library and jupyter-gmaps library
